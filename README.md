# Overview
In summary, the program is a numerical data processing tool that can perform a variety of operations on arrays, including filtering based on criteria, calculating aggregate values, and handling data with varying dimensions. The program takes input data, processes this data according to user-defined parameters (size, precision, filter conditions, etc.), and outputs the processed data. 

## Files and Their Functions

## aggregate.c & aggregate.h
Purpose: Implements aggregate functions for jagged arrays.

## mathpipe.c
Purpose: Serves as the main entry point for the library.
Functionality: Parses command-line arguments and directs operations for array processing.

## singular.c & singular.h
Purpose: Provides functions for processing individual elements in an array.

## How to Use
Compile the C files.      
Run mathpipe.c with appropriate command-line arguments for desired operations.
